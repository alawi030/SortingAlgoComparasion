## Sorting Algorithm Comparison

This project compares the performance of two sorting algorithms, namely Bubble Sort and Cycle Sort, using a given dataset. It visualizes the sorting process and measures the execution time of each algorithm. This project is useful for anyone interested in understanding and comparing different sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Bubble Sort implementation
- Cycle Sort implementation
- Visualization of the sorting process
- Performance measurement of sorting algorithms
- Comparison of sorting algorithms
