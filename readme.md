# Sorting Algorithms Comparasion

## Description

This project implements two sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort and Cycle Sort, and compares their performance using a given dataset. It also includes functionality to visualize the sorting process.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-directory`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install matplotlib`

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `data.txt` file is present in the project directory. This file should contain the dataset to be sorted, with each element on a new line.
2. Run the script: `python script.py`
3. The script will display two plots. The first plot shows the initial state of the dataset, and the second plot shows the sorted dataset.
4. The script will also print the execution time for each sorting algorithm and display a message indicating which algorithm is faster.
